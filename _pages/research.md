    <blockquote>In this paper, we introduce the concept of team moral identity, a team-level construct that represents the shared cognition that morality is a central, distinctive, and enduring attribute that defines the team. We draw from the theory of moral self, social identity theory, and self- verification literature to develop a model of the antecedents and outcomes of team moral identity. This model has theoretical implications for scholarship focusing on moral identity, collective identity, and behavioral ethics, and it holds numerous practical implications for those working in teams.</blockquote>

+ ### We Are a Moral Team: The Conceptualization, Measurement, and an Examination of Consequences of Team Moral Identity

    <blockquote>Moral identity has been one of the most frequently studied constructs in the field of behavioral ethics, yet previous studies have mostly examined moral identity as an individual phenomenon. Integrating the research findings from the collective identity and social identity literature, we examine moral identity at the team-level. In four studies, we develop a valid measure of team moral identity and explore its effects on various workplace outcomes. We find that team moral identity can take a different form depending on a unique set of moral values, i.e., conduct- or outcome-oriented moral characteristics, that a team regards as part of their definitional characteristics. We find that both conduct- and outcome-oriented team moral identities influence important moral and non-moral team outcomes, though their relational strengths can be vastly different as each team moral identity involves unique motivational influences on teams. Overall, this paper offers a theoretical and empirical basis for future research on team moral identity.</blockquote>

+ ### Moral Feedback: A Theory of Its Mechanisms, Contingencies, and Implications

    <blockquote>Moral self-regulation has attracted substantial research attention as a mechanism that explains employee moral behavior. However, an important piece of moral regulation has been largely overlooked in the literature, namely, supervisory moral feedback. To theoretically explain the behavioral corrective function of moral feedback, we define two different forms of supervisory moral feedback: criterion referenced and social comparison moral feedback. Drawing from the feedback intervention and moral decision-making literatures, we argue that criterion referenced moral feedback decreases subsequent employee immoral behavior through cognitive pathways, while social comparison moral feedback does so by distinct mechanisms involving social pathways. We also define three different dimensions of the behavioral correction, duration, breadth, and immediacy, and propose that the behavioral correction effect of moral feedback varies contingent upon factors at the individual, team, and organizational levels. The present conceptual analysis highlights supervisors’ role in guiding subordinates who are morally off track and offers practical guidance on how to administer moral feedback consistent with the moral goals of an organization.</blockquote>

+ ### How Does Coworker Social Status Drive Helping Behavior Among Members? Effect of Status-driven Helping on Team Performance 
*Under Review*. With Jin Nam Choi
    <details>
    <summary><font color="gray">Abstract +</font></summary>
    <blockquote>This study theorizes and examines how employees’ helping behavior is predicted by coworkers’ social status, which reflects the operation of an impression management motive. Drawing on social exchange theory and resource allocation framework, we further identify intragroup task conflict as a critical boundary condition that accentuates the role of coworker social status and further politicizes the helping behavior of employees. In view of the literature on the dark side of citizenship behavior, members’ status-driven helping behavior is expected to compromise team performance by reducing trust and coordination among team members. The current conceptual framework was empirically tested by field survey and online experimental studies. This study highlights the importance of distinct motives (prosocial, task-related, and self-serving) underlying citizenship behavior, which may lead to disparate individual and organizational outcomes.</blockquote>

+ ### Knowledge management behavior and individual creativity: Goal orientations as antecedents and in-group social status as moderating contingency

    <blockquote>Creativity is an increasingly important domain of performance largely based on knowledge held and exchanged among employees. Despite the necessity of knowledge exchange, individual employees tend to experience mixed motivation caused by the inherent social dilemma of knowledge sharing. To pragmatically explain how individuals deal with this motivational dilemma, we propose an expanded framework of knowledge management behavior (KMB) that includes knowledge sharing, hiding, and manipulation. Individual choices among these KMBs may be driven by dispositional goal orientations. We also propose that the effects of KMB on creativity of employees vary depending on their social status in a work group. Our analyses based on 214 employees from 37 teams reveal that (i) learning goal orientation increases knowledge sharing and decreases knowledge manipulation; (ii) avoiding goal orientation increases knowledge sharing and manipulation; and (iii) proving goal orientation increases knowledge hiding and manipulation. Knowledge hiding is negatively related to employee creativity, particularly for employees with high social status. Knowledge manipulation is positively related to creativity, particularly for those with high social status. This study develops and validates a theoretical framework explaining the formative process and distinct outcomes of the multifaceted and strategic approaches to KMB at the individual level.</blockquote>
