    <blockquote>This dissertation introduces the construct of team moral identity, which I define as a team’s shared sense of self that regards morality as a central, distinctive, and enduring characteristic of the team. In keeping with the literature on ethical theory, I delineate this construct as having two forms, conduct-oriented and outcome-oriented identity. Furthermore, I draw on the social identity and self-verification literatures to propose several critical antecedents and consequences of team moral identity. I validate a scale measuring team moral identity, examine the nomological network around the construct, and test several of the relationships proposed in the theoretical model using online, lab, and field data. The findings from this dissertation demonstrate that a) team moral identity dramatically impacts the functions and outcomes of a team, including those with moral and non-moral implications, and that b) conduct- and outcome-oriented team moral identity have distinct organizational implications.</blockquote>

>_Moral self-regulation has attracted substantial research attention as a mechanism that explains employee moral behavior. However, an important piece of moral regulation has been largely overlooked in the literature, namely, supervisory moral feedback. To theoretically explain the behavioral corrective function of moral feedback, we define two different forms of supervisory moral feedback: criterion referenced and social comparison moral feedback. Drawing from the feedback intervention and moral decision-making literatures, we argue that criterion referenced moral feedback decreases subsequent employee immoral behavior through cognitive pathways, while social comparison moral feedback does so by distinct mechanisms involving social pathways. We also define three different dimensions of the behavioral correction, duration, breadth, and immediacy, and propose that the behavioral correction effect of moral feedback varies contingent upon factors at the individual, team, and organizational levels. The present conceptual analysis highlights supervisors’ role in guiding subordinates who are morally off track and offers practical guidance on how to administer moral feedback consistent with the moral goals of an organization._

### How Does Coworker Social Status Drive Helping Behavior Among Members? Effect of Status-driven Helping on Team Performance (With Jin Nam Choi, Under review at OBHDP)

This study theorizes and examines how employees’ helping behavior is predicted by coworkers’ social status, which reflects the operation of an impression management motive. Drawing on social exchange theory and resource allocation framework, we further identify intragroup task conflict as a critical boundary condition that accentuates the role of coworker social status and further politicizes the helping behavior of employees. In view of the literature on the dark side of citizenship behavior, members’ status-driven helping behavior is expected to compromise team performance by reducing trust and coordination among team members. The current conceptual framework was empirically tested by field survey and online experimental studies. This study highlights the importance of distinct motives (prosocial, task-related, and self-serving) underlying citizenship behavior, which may lead to disparate individual and organizational outcomes.

    <blockquote>Creativity is an increasingly important domain of performance largely based on knowledge held and exchanged among employees. Despite the necessity of knowledge exchange, individual employees tend to experience mixed motivation caused by the inherent social dilemma of knowledge sharing. To pragmatically explain how individuals deal with this motivational dilemma, we propose an expanded framework of knowledge management behavior (KMB) that includes knowledge sharing, hiding, and manipulation. Individual choices among these KMBs may be driven by dispositional goal orientations. We also propose that the effects of KMB on creativity of employees vary depending on their social status in a work group. Our analyses based on 214 employees from 37 teams reveal that (i) learning goal orientation increases knowledge sharing and decreases knowledge manipulation; (ii) avoiding goal orientation increases knowledge sharing and manipulation; and (iii) proving goal orientation increases knowledge hiding and manipulation. Knowledge hiding is negatively related to employee creativity, particularly for employees with high social status. Knowledge manipulation is positively related to creativity, particularly for those with high social status. This study develops and validates a theoretical framework explaining the formative process and distinct outcomes of the multifaceted and strategic approaches to KMB at the individual level.</blockquote>
