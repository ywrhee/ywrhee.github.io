Young Won Rhee is a Ph.D. candidate in Management at the Michael G. Foster School of Business, University of Washington. His research program focuses on the intersection between behavioral ethics and teams, exploring what makes an ethical team and what are some organizational consequences of being so. He also studies the cross-level dynamics between teams and individuals revolving around topics of behavioral ethics. For example, he studies how moral beliefs and moral behaviors of team members impact team processes and outcomes through a unique upward influence process, as well as how a team's ethical context and characteristics impact membersâ€™ work behaviors and outcomes.  

Young Won's research has been published in several peer-reviewed journals such as the Journal of Organizational Behavior and the European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology. A chapter of his dissertation work on a novel construct of team moral identity has been accepted as the Best Paper Proceedings of the Academy of Management Annual Meeting. His other research is undergoing review at the Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes. 

When not focused on his research, Young can be found in the outdoors with his wife - hiking, exploring the city and taking photos of it, and spending time in local gardens and parks.
